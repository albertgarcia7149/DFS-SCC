# DFS-SCC
Given a graph it finds the strongly connected components using Depth First Search

Programmed using C

Given an input file like __in.txt__

Gives the output file __out.txt__

File information:

__FindComponents.c__ takes an input file and an output file prints the adjacency list and the number of strongly connected components along with the SCC forests

__Graph.c__ - standard graph ADT implementation file

__Graph.h__ - standard graph ADT header file

__GraphTest.c__ - basic testing of the graph ADT

__List.c__ - standard list ADT implementation file

__List.h__ - standard list ADT header file

__Makefile__ - compiles the files
